          What is APY?
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is a crucial financial metric used to
          measure the potential rate of return on an investment or deposit
          account over the course of one year. Unlike the nominal interest rate,
          which only accounts for the base interest earned, APY takes into
          consideration the compounding effect. It provides a more accurate
          representation of the actual yield, as it incorporates the interest
          earned on the initial investment, as well as the interest earned on
          any previously accumulated interest.

          Calculating APY from Last Week Results
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          At our company, we understand the importance of providing accurate and
          transparent information to our clients. To calculate APY based on the
          results from the previous week, we utilize a compounding formula. This
          formula takes into account the interest earned during the week and
          compounds it over the course of a year. By utilizing the weekly
          results, we can provide you with a realistic estimate of the potential
          yield of your investment. This method is especially beneficial when
          compounding occurs more frequently, allowing for a more precise
          assessment of your returns.

          Why Consider APY?

              Accurate Comparison: APY allows you to compare different
              investment products on an equal footing. By considering the
              compounding effect, it provides a standardized metric for
              evaluating the potential returns of various options.

              Realistic Expectations: Calculating APY based on the previous
              week's results provides a more current and relevant estimate of
              potential earnings. It helps you make informed decisions by
              considering the most recent performance of your investment.

              Incorporating Compounding: The compounding effect can
              significantly impact your overall returns. APY captures this
              effect, ensuring that you have a comprehensive understanding of
              the potential growth of your investment over time.
